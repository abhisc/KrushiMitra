# KrushiMitra MCP System Enhancement

## Overview
The MCP (Model Context Protocol) system has been enhanced to provide better intent detection, response parsing, and error handling for the KrushiMitra farming assistant.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Intent Detection
- **More Specific Patterns**: Improved regex patterns to better distinguish between different types of queries
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each pattern has a confidence score to prioritize more specific matches
- **Fallback Handling**: Uses `askAnything` flow as a safe fallback when no specific pattern matches

### 2. Better Parameter Extraction
- **Location Detection**: Improved extraction of location names from user queries
- **Crop Detection**: Better identification of crop names in disease queries
- **Symptom Detection**: Enhanced detection of plant symptoms and issues

### 3. Robust Response Parsing
- **Multiple Format Support**: Handles various response formats from different flows and tools
- **Consistent Output**: Ensures all responses are formatted consistently
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of malformed responses

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Detailed Error Messages**: More informative error messages for debugging
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to work even when individual components fail
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Intent Detection Patterns

### Weather Queries
- High confidence: `weather today`, `current weather`, `weather now`
- Medium confidence: `weather forecast`, `weather prediction`
- Low confidence: `weather`, `climate`, `temperature`, `rain`

### Disease Diagnosis
- High confidence: `crop disease`, `plant sick`, `yellow leaf`, `brown leaf`
- Medium confidence: `diagnose`, `problem crop`, `issue plant`

### Market Analysis
- High confidence: `market price`, `price market`, `sell crop`, `buy crop`
- Medium confidence: `marketplace`, `market data`, `price trend`

### Government Schemes
- High confidence: `government scheme`, `scheme government`, `subsidy`
- Medium confidence: `loan farm`, `credit farm`, `assistance farm`

## Response Format Handling

The system now handles multiple response formats:

1. **String responses**: Direct text responses
2. **Object with response field**: `{ response: "text" }`
3. **Object with text field**: `{ text: "content" }`
4. **Object with message field**: `{ message: "content" }`
5. **Complex objects**: JSON stringified for display

## Debugging Features

### MCP Debugger
- **Intent Analysis**: Logs user input and detected intent with confidence scores
- **Response Analysis**: Tracks response parsing and format detection
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error logging

### Test Page
- **Quick Test Queries**: Pre-defined test cases for common scenarios
- **Raw Response Display**: Shows both parsed and raw responses
- **Error Visualization**: Clear error display with suggestions

## Usage Examples

### Weather Query
```
User: "What's the weather today in Mumbai?"
Intent: getWeatherAndIrrigationTips (95% confidence)
Parameters: { location: "Mumbai" }
```

### Disease Diagnosis
```
User: "My tomato plants have yellow leaves, what's wrong?"
Intent: diagnoseCropDisease (90% confidence)
Parameters: { text: "My tomato plants have yellow leaves, what's wrong?", crop: "tomato", symptoms: "yellow" }
```

### Market Analysis
```
User: "What are the current market prices for wheat?"
Intent: getMarketAnalysis (90% confidence)
Parameters: { location: "Mumbai", crop: "wheat" }
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Visit `/mcp-test` to access the enhanced test page
2. Use quick test queries to verify functionality
3. Check browser console for debug logs

### Common Test Cases
- Weather queries with location
- Crop disease diagnosis
- Market price inquiries
- Government scheme questions
- General farming questions

## Troubleshooting

### "No response received" Error
1. Check if the MCP server is running
2. Verify the flow/tool exists in server info
3. Check browser console for detailed error logs
4. Use the test page to isolate the issue

### Incorrect Intent Detection
1. Review the debug logs for intent analysis
2. Check if the user query matches expected patterns
3. Consider adding new patterns for edge cases

### Response Parsing Issues
1. Check the response analysis logs
2. Verify the flow/tool returns expected format
3. Test with the enhanced test page

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning**: Implement ML-based intent detection
2. **Context Awareness**: Maintain conversation context across queries
3. **Multi-language Support**: Add support for regional languages
4. **Voice Integration**: Enhanced voice input processing
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics
